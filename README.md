# 50-Mon

Assignment 7 of *CS50 Introduction to Games Development* (by EDX/HarvardX) was to implement new features for *50-Mon* (essentailly a clone of the early Pokémon games). The purpose of this activity was to get comfortable with using StateStacks as a data structure, and how we can use them to layer game states to create GUI elements, menus, etc.

## Requirements
- LÖVE 2D 0.10.2 [Super Toast] -> https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/0.10.2

## Topics
- StateStacks
- Turn Based Systems
- GUIs
- RPG Mechanics

## Assessment Criteria
- Implement a Menu that appears during the player Pokémon's level up that shows, for each stat *X + Y = Z*; where X is the starting stat, Y is the amount it's increased for this level, and Z is the resultant sum.
